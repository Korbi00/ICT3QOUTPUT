			<p> <b>Ovis apparel</b> is a clothing line centered on wool-made garments such as shoes, t-shirts, sweat shirts, and pants. Wool is a textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals. it is the soft wavy or curly usually thick undercoat of various hairy mammals and especially the sheep made up of a matrix of keratin fibers and covered with minute scales. Wool is renewable, biodegradable, recyclable, and can be produced organically, On average, wool fabric uses 18% less energy than polyester, and almost 70% less water than cotton to produce as many as 100 garments. As wool makes such a low impact on the environment during its creation, it's one of the most environmentally friendly fabrics around, and Wool products can last longer, require less frequent washing at low temperatures, is readily recyclable, and also is biodegradable in both land and water and does not contribute to any microplastic pollution.</p>
			<p> <b>Ovis apparel</b> got its name from the scientific name of sheep where wool is commonly got from, <em>Ovis Aries</em>. <em>Ovis Aries</em> are domesticated, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. Although the term sheep can apply to other species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to domestic sheep. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates.</p>
